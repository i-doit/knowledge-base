# Dashboard and Widgets

To be provided with the most important information upon signing in to i-doit you can customize your dashboard with useful widgets. Each user in i-doit has his own dashboard and can personalize his own view of data. Should you have set up the “ultimate” dashboard, you can even define it as default dashboard or transfer it to specific users.

Access
------

You can reach the dashboard automatically after signing in to i-doit. Alternatively, you can click on the [![icon](../assets/images/en/basics/dashboard-and-widgets/1-daw.png)](../assets/images/en/basics/dashboard-and-widgets/1-daw.png) symbol in the breadcrumb navigation or on the i-doit logo in the top left corner.

Available Widgets
-----------------

!!! success "Multi-selection"

    You can put individual widgets repeatedly on your dashboard, for example, to display multiple reports.

### CMDB Status Lifecycle

You can select one or more objects with help of the pencil and have their status history visualized in a graph.

### CMDB-Explorer

A smaller variant of the regular [CMDB-explorer](../evaluation/cmdb-explorer/index.md) without extended features can be displayed here. For this purpose, select an object with the pencil which is loaded automatically when the dashboard is started.

### Calendar

The calendar widget marks fixed dates or events in bold letters. For this purpose, a check has to be set via the pencil so that object dates, such as the status planning, are considered. It is mandatory to have the role of  “administrator” for that particular object with a planned status, so that the calendar entry will be shown.

[![Calendar](../assets/images/en/basics/dashboard-and-widgets/6-daw.png)](../assets/images/en/basics/dashboard-and-widgets/6-daw.png)

As an alternative, you can define your own dates or events which are then displayed in the calendar via the widget settings.

### Service Consistency Check

The consistency check examines the status of objects which are part of a service. Its purpose is to find a status among those objects which might threaten the status of the service. In our example, the objects are all in the CMDB status “stored”, which is why the superordinated service might be threatened.

!!! attention "Performance"

    Please note that the performance of the dashboard may be negatively affected in case of many services and documented relationships.

[![Performance](../assets/images/en/basics/dashboard-and-widgets/26-daw.png)](../assets/images/en/basics/dashboard-and-widgets/26-daw.png)

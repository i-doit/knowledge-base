# Cronjobs Setup

Many tasks in i-doit can be automated with help of the CLI tool [controller](../automation-and-integration/cli/index.md). We use it to maintain the IT documentation on a regular basis.

The setup of cronjobs is optional. However, we definitely recommend using this option, at best directly after the [IT documentation](../glossary.md).

!!! success "Cronjobs setup - yes or no?"

    The setup of cronjobs is optional. However, we definitely recommend using this option, at best directly after the [installation](../installation/index.md).

Simplify Access of the Controller  
------------------------------------

To simplify the process to access the controller, you can use a simple bash script:

    sudo nano /usr/local/bin/idoit

The script gets the following contents which have to be adapted to your own installation:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    ##
    ## i-doit console
    ##

    ##
    
    set -euo pipefail
    
    ##
    ## Configuration
    ##
    
    INSTANCE_PATH="/var/www/html/i-doit"
    APACHE_USER="www-data"
    ARGS="$*"
    
    ##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    function execute {
        local prefix=""
        local console="php console.php $ARGS"
    
        test "$(whoami)" != "$APACHE_USER" && prefix="sudo -u $APACHE_USER "
    
        eval "${prefix}${console}" || abort "i-doit console exited with non-zero status"
    }
    
    function setup {
        cd "$INSTANCE_PATH" || abort "No i-doit instance found under '${INSTANCE_PATH}'"
    }
    
    function finish {
        exit 0
    }
    
    function abort {
        echo -e "$1"  1>&2
        echo "Operation failed. Please check what is wrong and try again." 1>&2
        exit 1
    }
    
    function log {
        echo -e "$1"
    }
    
    ##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" = "$0" ]]; then
        setup && execute && finish
    fi

Afterwards, the execution of the script is enabled:  

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/idoit

!!! attention "sudo"

    The script automatically obtains the right permissions through the use of **sudo**.
    The currently logged-in user needs the permission to use the **sudo** command. Under Debian GNU/Linux 9 add the user to the **sudo** group. This requires **root** rights:

        usermod -aG sudo "$(whoami)"

    The option **Defaults targetpw**, which prevents this mechanism, is set under [SLES](../installation/manual-installation/suse-linux-enterprise-server.md). Therefore you have to comment out this option in the **/etc/sudoers** file.

From now on, every user can use it:

    idoit COMMAND [OPTIONEN]

Create Essential Jobs
---------------------

In the next step we create another script which we can call up both manually and automatically:

    sudo nano /usr/local/bin/idoit-jobs

This script gets the following contents:

    #!/bin/bash
    
    ##
    ## i-doit jobs

    function execute {

        test "$(whoami)" != "$APACHE_USER" && prefix="sudo -u $APACHE_USER "

        eval "${prefix}${CONSOLE_BIN} logbook-archive $suffix" || \

            abort "Script '${CONSOLE_BIN}' not found"
    
        test -d "$INSTANCE_PATH" || \

    function log {

    }
    
    function finish {
        log "Done. Have fun :-)"
        exit 0
    }
    
    function abort {
        echo -e "$1"  1>&2
        echo "Operation failed. Please check what is wrong and try again." 1>&2
        exit 1
    }
    
    ##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" = "$0" ]]; then
        setup && execute && finish
    fi

Afterwards, the execution of the script is enabled:  

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/idoit-jobs

From now on, every user can use it:

    idoit-jobs

The following tasks are carried out when the script is executed:  

*   File caches in the **temp/** directory are emptied.
*   [Update packages](../maintenance-and-operation/update.md) which are not required anymore are deleted.
*   Older [logbook](../basics/logbook.md) entries are archived.
*   The cache for [user rights](../efficient-documentation/rights-management/index.md) is build up afresh.
*   ["Unfinished" objects](../basics/life-and-documentation-cycle.md) are deleted irrevocably.
*   The [search index](../efficient-documentation/search.md) is created freshly.
*   [Notifications](../evaluation/notifications.md) are sent via e-mail.  

Automation of Jobs Calls
------------------------

### When and how often?  

We recommend executing the above mentioned jobs at least once per day. You should ensure that no other interactions are carried out in i-doit during the execution - neither via the web GUI nor through additional scripts or by external applications via the API. Therefore the jobs are usually carried out during the night.

### GNU/Linux  

Under Linux you can run automated commands on a regular basis. You could use [cron, anacron, crontab](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or [systemd.timer](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.timer.html).

### Windows

The scripts mentioned in this article do not work under Windows withour further ado and should be replaced by equivalent scripts. Windows tasks are suitable for the automation.

### Catch problems

In order to intercept possible errors and to report them to the responsible system administrator, you can configure the operating system in such a way that e-mails are sent correspondingly. A simple mailer is **[**sSMTP**](https://wiki.debian.org/sSMTP)**. However, the **idoit-jobs** script creates a lot of output on the shell. You can apply the **chronic** tool to achieve that only errors are reported. This tool can be installed retroactively on many operating systems, often it is contained in the [**moreutils**](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/) distribution package.

!!! attention chronic under SLES

    The **moreutils** package and thus the **chronic** tool are not part of [SLES](../installation/manual-installation/suse-linux-enterprise-server.md). Therefore you have to download **chronic** manually from the website:

        wget https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/moreutils.git/plain/chronic
        chmod +x chronic
        sudo mv chronic /usr/bin/
        wget -O - https://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
        sudo cpanm --notest --install IPC::Run

### Example for Cron

We create a new file for Cron:

    sudo nano /etc/cron.d/i-doit

The file obtains the following contents:

    ## i-doit cron jobs

    MAILTO="sysadmin@i-doit.example.net"

    5 5 * * *   www-data    test -x /usr/local/bin/idoit-jobs && /usr/bin/chronic /usr/local/bin/idoit-jobs

Every day at 5:05 a.m. the **idoit-jobs** script is executed with the permissions of the Apacheuser **www-data**. To achieve that only errors are sent per mail, we use ****chronic****. The errors are sent via mail notifications.

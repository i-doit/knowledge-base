# Efficient Documentation

In the beginning, when you start to deal with the structure of i-doit, you will realize that i-doit is primarily a structured database with a graphical interface. Far from it - some features are available to help you document as fast and easily as possible. To succeed in the manual handling of the documentation you can find many tips and tricks in the following subpages:

*   [List Editing](./list-editing.md) 
*   [Mass Change](./mass-change.md)
*   [Duplicate Objects](./duplicate-objects.md)  
*   [Templates](./templates.md)
*   [Validation and Mandatory Fields](./validation-and-mandatory-fields.md)
*   [Rights Management](./rights-management/index.md)
*   [Search](./search.md)
*   [Object Lock](./object-lock.md)

By the way: There is much more to i-doit than manual documentation. But this is [another chapter](./../automation-and-integration/index.md).

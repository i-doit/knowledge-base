# Workplaces

Which IT components are available for which staff member and where can I find them? To ensure that you always have a good overview with regard to this question, you can document IT workplaces in i-doit.

Persons and their Workplaces
----------------------------

Besides the physical assignement of [objects](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) to [locations](./locations.md), workplaces can be documented as logical construct. The **Workplace** [object type](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) plays a central role.

An object of this type is assigned to a person via the **Logical Location** [category](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md).

Conversely, this person is assigned to one or more workplaces via the **Persons** object in the **Assigned Workplaces** category.

IT Components at the Workplace
------------------------------

The assignment of any (IT) components to a workplace is carried out in the **Workplace components** category within the **Workplace** object.

A workplace component can only be assigned to one workplace. You can search for the specific workplace of a component within the category **Assigned workstation** in the **Workplace components** object.

Location of a Workplace
-----------------------

Last but not least, you can also physically locate a workplace, for example with an office room. With the [**Floor Plan**](../i-doit-pro-add-ons/floorplan.md) add-on you can then even visualize this room.

Relocation of a Workplace
-------------------------

Should a person change the room within the company, you can manage the relocation of the workplace and selected workplace components. The **[Relocate CI](../i-doit-pro-add-ons/relocate-ci.md)** add-on offers a function solution for a relocation.

# Custom Translation

Using the user-defined translation, you can change the name of the desired fields or add new languages within a few mouse clicks.

**Create a language**

*   Navigate to Administration>CMDB Settings>User Defined Translation
*   Click on New to create a new language
*   Enter the language, select the flag and click on Save

You can now select the language in i-doit, but so far it is still identical to the German language.

Therefore you have to translate the fields now.

**Translation of a field**

As an example we change the name of the Quickpurge button.

# Documentation of Databases

With version 1.xx of i-doit we have added an additional variant that can be used to document databases within i-doit.

The two models differ in that the old model included the following three object types:

[![documentation-databases-models](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/1-dod.png)](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/1-dod.png)

**DBMS** - this object type corresponds to that of normal applications, we can define here which database software is available in the company.

**Database instance** - this object type shows where the individual DBMS are installed and which instances are available there.

**Database schema** - this object type shows the respective databases defined within each instance.

Using i-doit as an example, MariaDB would be the DBMS, the installation on the i-doit server would be the instance and the idoit\_system and i-doit\_data would be the database schema.

In the new model, we are taking a slightly different approach here. We keep the DBMS object, but add the Assigned Databases tab in the list view of the DBMS - Database Installation category. This makes it possible to see directly at the DBMS object which databases are provided by the respective database software. To stay with the example of i-doit, the MariaDB DBMS object would show the installation on the respective server and the databases idoit\_data and idoit\_system.

In the new model the object types database schema and database instance are dropped and replaced by a new category databases. The idea here is to document databases where they are executed. So if a database runs on a server, we assign the category there and maintain it directly at the resource. If the database runs on a cluster, we assign the category to the cluster objects and document there.

The new category offers a new view of the database hierarchy that can be expanded:

Below _Databases -> Databases_ we can now document the respective databases running on the resource:

[![documentation-databases-models](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/3-dod.png)](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/3-dod.png)

Below _Databases -> DBMS_ we see the connection to the respective DBMS object to which the server has a relationship.

**Migration of existing database documentation to the new model**

You can decide which type of database documentation is better suited for your needs. If you want to change from the old model to the new one we offer a moderation function which you can find in the administration under System Tools -> Cache Database:

[![documentation-databases-models](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/5-dod.png)](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/5-dod.png)
After clicking you will get another message about the effect of the migration:

[![documentation-databases-models](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/6-dod.png)](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/6-dod.png)

And when the migration is complete, a message will appear indicating whether the migration was successful:

[![documentation-databases-models](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/7-dod.png)](../assets/images/en/use-cases/documentation-of-databases/7-dod.png)

# Manage Passwords

Every day a system administrator handles dozens of passwords. It is a big challenge to keep all those passwords in mind. i-doit provides a simple password management which keeps your head clear for essential tasks and helps you to find the required access data much faster.

Distinction Between i-doit and Password Managers
------------------------------------------------

i-doit is not a fully-fledged password manager like [KeePass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePass). Such applications provide a lot of additional functions, for example, the generation of passwords.

The aim of the functions shown here is to bring access data as close as possible to an [IT documentation](../glossary.md). In case of emergency, these data have to be retrieved as fast and easy as possible.

If you can't do (or don't want to do) without a password manager, you can instead set corresponding links for your entries in the password manager with help of the **Access** category. In this way you only need a few clicks to get to your access data very fast.

**Passwords** Category
------------------------

You can store any number of access data for each [object](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) with the **Passwords** [category](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md). The data are saved in encoded form in the respective [tenant](../system-administration/multi-tenant.md) database of i-doit.

# Switch Stacking

With the **Stacking** [object type](../glossary.md) you can define a stack group of several members which exchange information. Although you can use stacking for different object types, the original idea for this object type and the associated **Stack member** [category](../glossary.md) is based on Switch Stacking. From version 1.7 the object type can be found under the [object type group](../glossary.md) **Other**.

Stack Members
-------------

You can add [objects](../glossary.md) as members of the stack and specify them as "Active" or "Passive" in the **Stack member** category, which was especially created for stacking. Beside the corresponding display, this specification has no other effect  on the documentation.

Logical Ports
-------------

When a logical port is created in one of the stack members, this port is also displayed with the other stack members under the logical ports section.

Additionally, cou can assign the logical port of another stack member as parent port to the port.

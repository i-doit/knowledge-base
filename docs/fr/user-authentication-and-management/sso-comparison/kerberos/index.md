# Single Sign On (SSO)

The authentication via Single Sign On (SSO) is well suited for an automated sign on to i-doit within an intranet.

!!! info "This article was last checked for i-doit version 1.17.2"

!!! info "This tutorial does not work anymore with Debian 11 because the Apache2 module mod_auth_kerb is not available anymore."

    You should use [GSSAPI](../gssapi/index.md) instead.

Requirements and Assumptions

The following conditions are the basis of this article:

*   i-doit is [installed](../../../installation/manual-installation/setup.md) on a GNU/Linux system
*   An [Active Directory (AD)](../../ldap-directory/index.md) on Windows Server 2008/2012 is used for the authentication.

This article describes how Single Sign On (SSO) is set up in an Apache web server with auth_kerb.

!!! attention "Case sensitivity"
    Special attention needs to be paid to upper and lower case letters in the configuration.

Configure Active Directory (AD)
-------------------------------

In AD a user is generated for the SSO access. Example:

*   Server name of i-doit: **idoit.mydomain.local**
*   AD domain: **addomain.local**
*   SSO user: **ssouser**
*   Password: **password**

A keytab file is generated on an AD domain controller using the admin user with help of the ktpass utilities.

```shell
ktpass -princ HTTP/idoit.mydomain.local@ADDOMAIN.LOCAL -mapuser ssouser@ADDOMAIN.LOCAL -crypto RC4-HMAC-NT -ptype KRB5_NT_PRINCIPAL -pass passwort -out c:\krb5.keytab
```

The generated krb5.keytab file is then copied to the _i-doit_ server at /etc/krb5.keytab.

Afterwards, **Active Directory Users and Computers** is opened (adsiedit.msc). At **View** the **Advanced Features** option is activated. Now the SSO user object is opened. Search for the values **userPrincipalName** and servicePrincipalName in the **Attribute Editor** tab. In both cases **exactly one entry** with the value **HTTP/idoit.mydomain.local** needs to be set.

Configure Apache Webserver
--------------------------

The module auth_kerb is required for the Apache web server.

Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu Linux:

```shell
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-auth-kerb
```

Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES):

```shell
sudo zypper in apache2-mod_auth_kerb
```

Activate the module:

```shell
sudo a2enmod auth_kerb
```

Now the configuration for Kerberos will be written (replace dc.mydomain.local by the domain controller):

```shell
    # cat /etc/krb5.conf
    [libdefaults]
    default_realm = ADDOMAIN.LOCAL

    [realms]
    ADDOMAIN.LOCAL = {
    admin_server = dc.mydomain.local
    kdc          = dc.mydomain.local
    }

    [domain_realm]
    idoit.mydomain.local = ADDOMAIN.LOCAL
    .mydomain.local = ADDOMAIN.LOCAL
    mydomain.local = ADDOMAIN.LOCAL
```

Execute the following command to test the configuration:

```shell
kinit ssouser@ADDOMAIN.LOCAL
```

The password of the SSO user is requested. With the command

```shell
klist
```
you can check whether or not a valid ticket exists.

Subsequently, the Apache configuration for the VHost at which _i-doit_ is accessible is supplemented within the Directory directive:

```shell
    <Directory "/path/to/i-doit/">
        AuthType Kerberos
        KrbAuthRealms ADDOMAIN.LOCAL
        KrbServiceName HTTP/idoit.mydomain.local@ADDOMAIN.LOCAL
        Krb5Keytab /etc/krb5.keytab
        KrbMethodNegotiate on
        KrbMethodK5Passwd off
        require valid-user
    </Directory>
```

In order to apply the changes the Apache web server needs to be restarted:

### Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu or Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES):

```shell
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
```

Configure i-doit
----------------

From version 1.5 on SSO can be configured via the web GUI of i-doit. The corresponding settings can be found at **Administration â†’ System settings**. There **SSO** needs to be activated.

Browser Client-side Configuration
---------------------------------

Lastly, each browser needs to be configured to automatically use SSO.

### Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE)

The _i-doit_ server needs to be added to the local intranet sites in the IE settings. After this, the item **Automatic logon with current username and password** has to be enabled under **User Authentication** within the **Custom level** option. Furthermore, make sure that you activate the option **Integrated Windowa authentication** in the **Advanced** tab of the **Internet options**.

### Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome

SSO is also possible for these browsers. Extensive information about the configuration can be found on the internet. You can find an example for Firefox [here](https://superuser.com/questions/664656/how-to-configure-firefox-for-ntlm-sso-single-sign-on).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Should you have problems regarding the authentication the following questions and hints may be of help:

*   Compare the time settings in Linux and Windows DC. Are they the same?
*   In most cases the server is only accessible via the full FQDN i-doit.mydomain.local.
*   Does the _i-doit_ server have access to the domain controller? Is there a firewall between these two?
*   Is the SSO domain user unlocked?
*   Can the DC be resolved per DNS from the _i-doit_ server?
*   Does the web server have read permission for the krb5.keytab file?

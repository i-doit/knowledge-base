# Creating a local user

i-doit already provides some local users with the default installation which you can use for the [initial login](../../basics/initial-login.md). This article describes how to create an additional local user.

!!! check "LDAP/AD"

    Most of the options described in this article are not limited to local users but can be combined in connection with the [LDAP/AD interface](../ldap-directory/index.md).

!!! check "Emergency"

    You can also use local users when external authorization interfaces, such as LDAP/AD or [SSO](../sso-comparison/index.md), are not available. By this means, you can always access the IT documentation in case of an emergency.

## Creating a New Object (Person)

Users in i-doit are a part of the IT documentation, therefore all users are an [object](../../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) of the type **Persons**. To create a local user, you initially create a new **Persons** object.

The object title (the **Title** attribute in the **General** category) should contain the complete name of the user. The object title corresponds directly with the attributes **First name** and **Last name** of the **Persons → Master data** category. If, for example, the last name of a user changes, the object title will be adapted automatically.

## Contact Details

It is very useful to fill in the details of the **Persons → Master data** category, especially the attributes **E-mail address** and **Telephone company**. If this person is assigned to another object (for example, as administrator of a server), these two attributes will be also displayed and thus allow quick contacting and communication without having to spend time for research. This link between person and server is carried out in the **Persons → Assigned Objects** category or within the server object in the **Contact assignment** category.

You can assign further e-mail addresses in the **E-Mail addresses** category.

## Local Login

The user requires a user name and a password for login; both are assigned in the **Persons → Login** category.

To create or edit a Password you need to click on the "Change password" button. If a password is set, the "Set empty" button is displayed

You can predefine the minimum length of a user password for each tenant. This can be carried out under **Administration → [Tenant Name] management → Settings for [Tenant Name] → Security → Minimum length of user passwords**. Enter a positive integer value in this field.

## User Settings

Each user can adapt i-doit individually. Many of these settings can be found under [**Administration → User settings**](../../system-administration/administration/user-settings/index.md).

## Login Credentials

Even if a user does not have the right to edit the above mentioned category **Persons → Login**, he or she can change their own password via **Administration → User settings → Login credentials**.

## Profile Picture

With the **Object picture** category you can upload a profile picture for each user.

## Additional Settings

Also in other areas the user has the option to make individual settings:

*   [Configuration of dashboard and widgets](../../basics/dashboard-and-widgets.md)
*   [Setting the profile in the CMDB explorer as default profile](../../evaluation/cmdb-explorer/profiles-in-the-cmdb-explorer.md)
*   [Activated filters in object lists](../../basics/object-list/navigation-and-filtering.md)

## User Rights

[Rights](../../efficient-documentation/rights-management/index.md) within i-doit can be assigned per user - or better - per person group. For this purpose, a user is assigned to the corresponding group. This group has the relevant rights which the user inherits. A user can be assigned to several groups and inherits the respective rights.

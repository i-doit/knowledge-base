# Software Development

How does development for, with or in i-doit work? i-doit is a web application which is based on the PHP script language and the MySQL/MariaDB database. The Web GUI is realized in HTML/CSS/JS. We let you see behind the curtains of the software. That is not only useful to expand i-doit functions but also helpful when you want to address the [API](../i-doit-pro-add-ons/api/index.md) or read data directly from the database.

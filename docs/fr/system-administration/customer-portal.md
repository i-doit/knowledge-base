# Customer Portal

A central contact point exists for users of i-doit pro. [Installation packages](../installation/index.md) and the currently valid [license](../maintenance-and-operation/activate-license.md) are available for download there. The subscription and buyers products (for example [add-ons](../i-doit-pro-add-ons/index.md)) are also listed there. The customer portal can be accessed at the following address:

**[portal.i-doit.com](https://portal.i-doit.com/)**

Access data are required for the customer portal. Customers of the i-doit pro version receive the necessary information for the creation of a user account during the ordering process.

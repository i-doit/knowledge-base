# MySQL/MariaDB Does Not Start After Changing innodb_log_file_size

Problem
-------

It is [recommended](../../installation/manual-installation/system-settings.md) to increase the value of innodb_log_file_size (depending on RAM) for a better performance of MySQL/MariaDB. After this change the service is restarted but only an error message appears:

    110216  9:48:41  InnoDB: Initializing buffer pool, size = 128.0M
    110216  9:48:41  InnoDB: Completed initialization of buffer pool
    InnoDB: Error: log file ./ib_logfile0 is of different size 0 5242880 bytes
    InnoDB: than specified in the .cnf file 0 33554432 bytes!
    110216  9:48:41 [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' init function returned error.
    110216  9:48:41 [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' registration as a STORAGE ENGINE failed.

Solution
--------

Terminate the service in a clean manner and remove all existing logs when changing this option, as described in a more comprehensive [answer at StackExchange](http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/1261/how-to-safely-change-mysql-innodb-variable-innodb-log-file-size):

    mysql -uroot -p -e"SET GLOBAL innodb_fast_shutdown = 0"
    sudo service mysql stop
    sudo mv /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile[01] /tmp
    sudo service mysql start

MySQL/MariaDB creates the logs again automatically. This can take some time in bigger databases. The new value for innodb_log_file_size is now active.

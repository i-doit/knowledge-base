[i-doit_1.13.2_hotfix_ID-7224_Admin-Center-Login.zip :material-file-download:](../../assets/downloads/hotfixes/i-doit_1.13.2_hotfix_ID-7224_Admin-Center-Login.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

After implementation, this hotfix provides a new command for [console.php](../../automation-and-integration/cli/index.md) to issue a new encrypted password for the Admin Center.  
The following command must be executed to reset the password:

    sudo -u www-data php console.php admin-center-password-reset --user User --password Password

The user www-data is the Apache user of a Debian system. This user has to be adapted to other systems. Furthermore in the sections --user and --password a user from i-doit is needed who has the permissions to use the console.

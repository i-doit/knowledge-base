# Events

The Event [add-on](../../../i-doit-pro-add-ons/events.md) allow for a high degree of automation when working with the [IT documentation](../../../glossary.md). If something is changed in the IT documentation, then third-party system will be informed about these changes. If, for example, a new VM is documented in i-doit, it can automatically be created and provisioned on a virtualization host.

# Expert settings (Tenant related)

The expert settings are a kind of "registry" of i-doit. Most settings are set via a option in the settings area. Also some option are only available when added here.

!!! attention "Caution"
    Usually it is not necessary to add or edit values in the expert settings. For normal use the Web GUI provides functions to control i-doit in all relevant cases.<br>
    Should you plan to carry out changes in the expert settings, we **strongly recommend** to make a **[backup](../../../maintenance-and-operation/backup-and-recovery/index.md)** beforehand. Some of the listed settings have a serious effect on the application. In case of doubt do not hesitate to ask for [support](../../customer-portal.md).

## Configuration

[![Configuration](../../../assets/images/en/system-administration/administration/tenant-mangement/expert-settings/1-es.png)](../../../assets/images/en/system-administration/administration/tenant-mangement/expert-settings/1-es.png)

Each setting consists of three parts:

| Key | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The **Key** assigns a unique name to the setting. If a key shouldn't exist yet, it can be added later. | The **Value** is usually a string or a longer text or an integer value. | With the **Type** you define the scope of the setting. A setting with the type **Tenant-wide** only affects the tenant with which the user is currently logged in. **User** means that the setting affects the User. |

# Checkmk2

## What is new (v1.8.5)

### Dynamic Filtering Using Whitelist and Blacklist

With the latest software update, users now have the ability to precisely control the import and synchronization process of software applications. By using regular expressions, users can define exactly which applications should be included or excluded during the process. A whitelist allows users to selectively choose specific software applications for processing. For example, the regular expression `^Windows Update.*$` ensures that all Windows updates are included in the process, while `^python[0-9.]+$` captures all Python versions.
Complementary to the whitelist, the blacklist provides a function to explicitly exclude applications from the import and synchronization process.

Additionally, an important change has been made to the configuration structure in this version: The parameter `createUnknownSoftwareApplications,` which was previously located in the main "pull" section, has been moved to the newly created `softwareApplications` subsection. This restructuring improves the clarity and modularity of the configuration settings.
For users who want to familiarize themselves with the new configuration structure, the command `./idoitcmk print-example-config`provides a convenient way to view an example of the new parameter arrangement.

## What is new (v1.8.2)

-   With version 1.8.2 CMK2 now supports Checkmk version 2.2.
-   If the config parameter check_mk.version is set to "2.2", the REST API is automatically accessed instead of the Web API.
-   If the config parameter check_mk.version is set to "2.1", the WebAPI is used unless there is a configuration section. "check_mk.rest" that can be used in parallel with the WebAPI configuration. Then the REST API is also used for 2.1.
-   This does not affect the calls to the Inventory API!

!!! info ""
    As a Gold Partner of Tribe29, SHD - System-Haus-Dresden GmbH is considered a proven specialist for monitoring with Checkmk. With the takeover and further development of the i-doit pro add-on Checkmk 2, SHD is now making this expertise available to i-doit users.

!!! attention ""
    With [Checkmk version 2.1.0b1](https://checkmk.com/werk/12389) the structure of the inventory data has been changed. It is currently not possible to transfer inventory to i-doit with CheckMK 2 add-on <=1.8<br>
    With version 1.8.1 the [configuration](./configuration.md) must be adjusted.

Share information between i-doit and checkmk

## About

[i-doit](https://i-doit.com) is a Web application for IT documentation and a CMDB (Configuration Management Database). This application is very useful to collect all your knowledge about the IT infrastructure you are dealing with.

[checkmk](https://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk.html) is a software application for network monitoring.

Together both applications do one job very well: collecting and sharing knowledge about what _is_ the current state of all your hosts and services in real-time _and_ in which state each host and service _should_ be. This is often essential for a professional and efficient IT service management (ITSM).

The application idoitcmk closely connects i-doit with checkmk. A lot of information will be shared between them to reach the following goals:

-   Write-once, read-many: Keep your documentation and configuration at one place.
-   Easily compare the current state with the target state of all your hosts and services within your documentation.
-   Configure your network monitoring based on your documentation
-   Let your network monitoring collect essential information about hosts and re-use it in your documentation.
-   Automate all the boring tasks a sysadmin doesn’t like.

We know each (IT) organization has different requirements and various processes. Due to this it is important to have a [highly customizable](./configuration.md) application.

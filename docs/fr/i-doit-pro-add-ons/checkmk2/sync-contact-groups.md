# checkmk 2: Sync contact groups

Check\_MK notifies contact groups on every event if properly configured. Within i-doit each contact group can be documented as an object. To share contact groups between both run:

    idoitcmk sync-contact-groups

This command will generate new objects in i-doit based on Check\_MKâ€™s contact groups. Additionally, objects in i-doit can be used to generate new contact groups.

By default, contact groups are stored as person groups in i-doit. You can simply add person objects to those groups and assign the groups to any other objects with the category contact assignment and the role monitoring.

**Recommendation:** Run this command every time you add a new contact group in Check\_MK or i-doit.

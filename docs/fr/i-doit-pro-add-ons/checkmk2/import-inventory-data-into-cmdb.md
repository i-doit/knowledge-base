# checkmk 2: Import inventory data into CMDB

You let checkmk monitor all your hosts? You let checkmk collect basic information about your hardware/software? Well, why not share these information with your CMDB? Import or update objects in i-doit by running:

    idoitcmk pull

**Recommendation:** Run this command every time you alter your WATO configuration in checkmk or whenever checkmk’s inventory agents find new hardware/software information.

Options
-------

These options are available during runtime:

| Option | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --include-alias STRING | No  | Filter hosts by alias |
| --include-folder STRING | No  | Filter hosts by WATO folder |
| --include-hostname STRING | No  | Filter hosts by name |
| --include-ipaddress STRING | No  | Filter hosts by IPv4/v6 address |
| --include-os STRING | No  | Filter hosts by operating system |
| --include-site STRING | No  | Filter hosts by monitoring site |
| --include-tag TAG | No  | Filter hosts by tag |

STRING means any string including wildcards *, ? and [ae]. Repeat option to match more than one STRING. For example, fetch all hosts with a GNU/Linux or Windows operating system:

    idoitcmk pull --include-os "*Linux*" --include-os "*Windows*"

Any combination of these filters are logically combined by or. For example, fetch all hosts with suffix .example.com or in folder cloud:

    idoitcmk pull --include-hostname "*.example.com" --include-folder "cloud"

TAG is like STRING but is a key/value combination with the tag name and its value. For example, fetch all hosts marked as business critical:

    idoitcmk pull --include-tag "criticality=critical"

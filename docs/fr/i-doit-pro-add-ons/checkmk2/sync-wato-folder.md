# checkmk 2: Sync WATO folders

Hosts can be hierarchical ordered in folders. These folders can be synced to i-doit and additional folders in i-doit can be used to generate new folders in checkmk. Just run:

    idoitcmk sync-folders

In i-doit these WATO folders are stored in the dialog+ attribute WATO folder in category Check_MK Host.

**Recommendation:** Run this command every time you add a new folder in checkmk or i-doit.

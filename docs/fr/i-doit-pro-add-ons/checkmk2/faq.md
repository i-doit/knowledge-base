# checkmk 2: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

We have collected some of the most asked questions about idoitcmk.

## Access hardware/software inventory

In a multi-site environment sites are able to collect hardware/software information from their monitored hosts. If you have configured idoitcmk to fetch information about your hosts from one site this site will need access to the other sites hardware/software inventory. To do so please make sure you have the following settings:

1.  Go to `WATO > Distributed Monitoring > Edit slave site > Livestatus settings > Connection`
2.  Select `Use Livestatus Proxy Daemon`
3.  Select option `CP port to connect to` for `Connect to`
4.  Add FQDN/IP and port for the selected slave which other sites can use
5.  Uncheck `Allow access via TCP`
6.  Save and activate your changes

Now you will see inside the Web GUI a button called **Inventory** on each status page of a host. This is a good indicator that idoitcmk may access inventory information via Web API as well.

## Multi-tenants

The add-on supports more than one tenants provided by i-doit. For each i-doit tenant you need to configure an unique API key.

For example, you already have created 2 or more tenants in i-doit. Create for each tenant a slightly different configuration file and add each tenants API key to the setting i-doit.key. The setting i-doit.url is always the same but the settings i-doit.username and i-doit.password may differ. For each tenant call idoitcmk and add the option --config:

```shell
idoitcmk --config tenant1.json
idoitcmk --config tenant2.json
```

You can even mix-up configuration files: One file contains common settings and the others are tenant-specific. For example:

```shell
idoitcmk --config common.js --config tenant1.json
idoitcmk --config common.js --config tenant2.json
```

## Compare host tags between checkmk and i-doit

Host tags are grouped in checkmk. This is an example for a tag group with all its tags:

```shell
Internal ID: criticality
Title: Criticality
Topic: -
Choices:
    1
        Tag ID: prod
        Description: Productive system
    2
        Tag ID: critical
        Description: Business critical
    3
        Tag ID: test
        Description: Test system
    4
        Tag ID: offline
        Description: Do not monitor this host
```

Via checkmk Web API you receive for the tag prod this key-value pair:

```shell
tag_criticality: prod
```

As you can see, the key of a tag group is prefixed by tag_ followed by its Internal ID, here: criticality. The Tag ID is used as the value.

On i-doit side these grouped tags are named static host tags. You find them in **Extras > Check_MK 2 > Tags (static)**. This is the representation of the tag prod mentioned above:

```shell
Host tag (id): prod
Display name: Productive system
Host group: criticality
Description: Criticality
```

Here is a direct comparison between checkmk and i-doit:

| checkmk | i-doit | i-doit key | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internal ID | Host group | group | criticality |
| Title | Description | -   | Criticality |
| Topic | -   | -   | -   |
| Tag ID | Host tag (ID) | const | prod |
| Description | Display name | val | Productive system |

## Self-signed certificates and other problems with TLS connections

It is common practice to enforce TLS-encrypted HTTPS connections between idoitcmk, i-doit and checkmk - even in firewalled private networks. Often self-signed x.509 certificates are used. That will no problem at all, if you take care of these steps:

-   The host idoitcmk runs on (precisely: OpenSSL which is used by cURL which is used by PHP) needs to verify the complete certificate chain, especially the root certificate. Therefore, import your root certificate on that host. You should test if everything works by running the status command:

```shell
idoitcmk status -v
```

-   Alternatively, but strictly not recommended just disable this certificate verification. You must disable it for both connections to i-doit and checkmk by adding two new configuration settings. Example:

```shell
idoitcmk status -v -s "i-doit.bypassSecureConnection=true" -s "check_mk.webAPI.bypassSecureConnection=true"
```

Please keep in mind that disabling verification does not protect your setup from man-in-the-middle attacks. This weakens your IT security significantly. You will be warned.

## checkmk responds with HTTP status code 2414"

Sometimes checkmk responds with HTTP status code 414 URI too long while requesting the hardware/software inventory API. For example, this could happen while executing the command pull:

```shell
idoitcmk pull
Import inventory data into CMDB

Looking for hosts in checkmk…
Found 1234 hosts

Read hardware/software inventory data for each host…
Web server responded with HTTP status code "414"
```

To prevent this error you should decrease the configuration setting `i-doit.limitBatchRequests`. Default value is 500. A value of 100 should be working.

## Duplicated Objects after pulling to i-doit

If the Matching seems not working properly, get sure that the categories "Checkmk Host" and "Checkmk Tags" are assigned to the Object types you pull to i-doit.For this you can use [Edit data structure](../../basics/assignment-of-categories-to-object-types.md)

It might also be necessary to reduce the [pull identifiers](./configuration.md) to e.g. hostname.

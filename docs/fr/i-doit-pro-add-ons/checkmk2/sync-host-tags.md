# checkmk 2: Sync host tags

checkmkâ€™s host and service checks are often based on its tagging system. You can share tag groups and the tags themselves with i-doit by running:

    idoitcmk sync-tags

Tags will be stored in i-doit under Extras > Check_MK 2 > Tags (static) and can be assigned to any objects with attribute Host tags in category Check_MK Tags.

**Recommendation:** Run this command every time you add new host tags/groups in checkmk.

If you create your own tags, it is important to fill in all fields so that the tags can be created in CheckMK. A mapping of the fields can be seen on the screenshot.

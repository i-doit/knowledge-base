# checkmk 2: Sync checkmk sites

checkmk provides a distributed monitoring of hosts and its services. You can configure multiple monitoring hosts which are called “sites”. To share these sites with i-doit run:

    idoitcmk sync-sites

_Sites without hosts are not considered._

In i-doit these sites are stored in the dialog+ attribute Site in category Check_MK Host.

**Recommendation:** Run this command every time you add a new site.

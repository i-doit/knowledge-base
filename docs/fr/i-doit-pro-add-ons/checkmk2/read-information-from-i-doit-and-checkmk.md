i-doit objects
--------------

List i-doit objects with command fetch-objects:

    idoitcmk fetch-objects

    idoitcmk fetch-objects -v

Type --help for command-line options to filter these objects.

checkmk hosts

    idoitcmk fetch-hosts

Fetch all available information about checkmk hosts:

    idoitcmk fetch-hosts -v

Fetch all hosts, but without “effective” attributes which are inherited from rulesets, folders, etc.:

Compare objects and hosts
-------------------------

The command [match](./match-objects-from-i-doit-with-hosts-from-checkmk.md) matches objects from i-doit with hosts from checkmk and prints detailed reports.

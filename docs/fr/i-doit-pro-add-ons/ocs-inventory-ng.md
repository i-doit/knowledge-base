# OCS Inventory NG

!!! info "Note"

    With the release of [i-doit pro 1.18.2](../version-history/release-notes/release-notes-1.18/release-notes-1.18.2.md) we have removed the previously integrated OCS functionality from the core. With this release, the interface has become an independent i-doit pro add-on and is now sold and further developed by our premium partner Sector Nord AG. All contents described here refer exclusively to i-doit pro versions < 1.18.2

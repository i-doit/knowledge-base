# Active Directory Documentation

The "Active Directory Documentation" add-on was designed and created as the first add-on with the Add-on Packager. The Active Directory Documentation add-on is designed to make it easier for administrators to document Microsoft environments. The add-on creates the necessary object types and categories.

Installation and License

The "Active Directory Documentation" add-on is installed like any other add-on via the Admin Center. The add-on does not require a license. However, it can only be used with the pro variant.

Contents of the add-on
----------------------

The "Active Directory Documentation" add-on brings a collection of object types, categories and Dialog+ entries.

Two new object type groups "Active Directory" and "Windows Systems" are created with the new object types:

| Active directory | Windows Systems |
| --- | --- |
| Domain | DHCP Server |
| Forest | DNS Server |
| Site | Windows client |
| Certificate authority | Window server |

In the following, the individual object types with the newly delivered categories are briefly explained.

Domain
------

The delivered object type "Domain" allows to document the most common information of a domain.   
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Category |
| --- |
| Domain information |
| Domain schema |
| Domain structure |
| FSMO roles |
| Domain trusts |
| Assigned domain controller |
| Directory partitions |
| Assigned sites |

Forest
------

The new object type makes it possible with the supplied categories to document all necessary information of a structure.  
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Category |
| --- |
| FSMO roles |
| Forest information |
| Forest trusts |
| Assigned catalogue server |

[![Forest](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/2-adc.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/2-adc.png)

Certificate authority
---------------------

The "Certificate authority" enables the exact documentation of certificates. Here the name-giving object type makes possible to document the issuing certification authority, as well as the issued certificates.  
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Category |
| --- |
| Issued certificates |
| Zertifizierungsstelle |

[![Certificate authority](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/3-adc.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/3-adc.png)

Windows server
--------------

The new object type "Windows Server" is fundamentally based on the object type "Server". Here, however, increased emphasis is placed on the benefit and its relationships to the Active Directory.  
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Category |
| --- |
| Domain controller |
| FSMO information |
| Global catalogue |
| LDAP |
| NTFS shares |
| Server roles |
| Windows services |
| Windows events |
| Windows features |
| Windows information |
| Windows server group |
| Windows update |

Windows client
--------------

The new object type "Windows client" is fundamentally based on the object type "Client". Here, however, as with the Windows Server, increased emphasis is placed on the benefit and its relationships to the Active Directory.  
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Category |
| --- |
| RDP settings |
| Windows information |

[![Windows client](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/4-adc.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/4-adc.png)

DNS server
----------

The "DNS Server" object type is fundamentally based on the "Windows Server" object type. This enables separate documentation of DNS information. The "DNS Documentation" DNS add-on is available for special DNS documentation.  
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Kategorie |
| --- |
| DNS zone entries |
| Assigned DNS server |

[![DNS server](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/5-adc.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/5-adc.png)

DHCP server
-----------

The "DHCP server" object type is fundamentally based on the "Windows Server" object type. This enables separate documentation of DHCP information.   
The following categories are delivered with the object type:

| Category |
| --- |
| DHCP zones |
| Assigned DHCP server |

[![DHCP server](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/6-adc.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/active-directory-documentation/6-adc.png)

# VIVA-Widget

i-doit has a dashboard with configurable widgets that provide the user with all kinds of information the first time they call up i-doit, so they can gain an overview of the IT documentation more quickly. But widgets are not only suitable for this, but also for information from the VIVA add-on. It brings its own widget that contains the reports.

The configuration of the widget includes a selection of one or more information associations whose report overview should be displayed as a widget. Each time the dashboard is loaded, all the selected reports are executed in real time and their results are displayed. The user can click on the individual results to get a detailed view. In addition, the user can also click on the name of the information network to go to the corresponding page of VIVA.

# Use Forms

## Opening the add-on

After all preparations are completed, the add-on can be accessed via Extras > Forms.

[![Use Forms](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/1-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/1-usf.png)

## Create forms

A form is created via the [![Create forms](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/2-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/2-usf.png) button.

The process begins with the assignment of the form title.<br>
Then an object type is selected that is created by the form respectively by the user's input.

Now we can add elements to be displayed in the form.<br>
Possible elements are _attributes_, _headlines_, _texts_ and _dividing lines_.

The order of the elements can be changed afterwards, via drag&drop.

Already created elements can be deleted [![icon](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/5-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/5-usf.png) or duplicated [![icon](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/6-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/6-usf.png).  
Of course, you can also distribute the form over several pages.<br>
The pages can be moved and deleted like the other elements.

## Available elements

### **Headline**

[![Headline](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/8-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/8-usf.png)

The headline style can be H1, H2 or H3.

### **Text**

[![Text](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/9-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/9-usf.png)

A text can be entered for the text element. There is an option to hide the element for users.

**Dividing Line**

[![Dividing Line](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/10-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/10-usf.png)

### **Attribute**

If such an element is added, the attribute selection opens directly.<br>
Here, all categories are displayed that are assigned to the object type in i-doit.

[![Attribute](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/11-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/11-usf.png)

[![Attribute](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/12-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/12-usf.png)

The field name in the element can be changed.<br>
In addition, a pre-defined value can be stored, this value will then be pre-filled.

[![Attribute](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/13-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/13-usf.png)

The Hide element for recipients setting is used to hide fields for users.<br>
This allows the form to include values defined by the creator (pre-defined values) in the object to be created.<br>
If the setting is activated, this is visualized by a crossed-out eye [![](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/14-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/14-usf.png).

In addition, these elements can be marked as required Field cannot be blank.<br>
These attribute elements must then not be blank. This is made clear by the lettering REQUIRED [![Attribute](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/16-usf.png)](../../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/forms/use-forms/16-usf.png).

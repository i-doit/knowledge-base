# Configure the Forms Backend

First, we navigate to the Form Backend subfolder within the i-doit installation:

    cd /var/www/html/src/classes/modules/forms/backend/

We create a copy of the configuration template:

    sudo -u www-data cp .env.dist .env

Using a text editor like, vi or nano, we now edit the .env:

    sudo nano .env

!!! attention "The 'FORMS\_SECRET' must not be empty. The key can consist of alphanumeric and special characters."

We now set a FORMS\_SECRET and save the file.

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FORMS\_SECRET | 'g87z$t2r346aSdas%&f52458g724g875!' | Key for encrypting the data in the database.  <br>Must not be empty!  <br>Example: FORMS_SECRET='h982t)24/(&%houaq3ho4' |
| FORMS\_PORT | '3000' | Port for connections  <br>Example: FORMS_PORT='3000' |
| FORMS\_MONGO\_DB\_SERVER | 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/forms' | URL and port to connect to the MongoDB server  <br>Example: FORMS_MONGO_DB_SERVER='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/forms' |

Next, we create an instance.

To use the run.sh, we must first set the rights to run:

    sudo chmod +x run.sh

Now we can run the run.sh:

    sudo ./run.sh instance:create {Username} {Apikey}

!!!info ""
    Each Forms instance has its own API and gets its own {Username} and {Apikey}. These can be defined freely and have nothing in common with the i-doit pro API.

    The data must be noted during the installation, because they must be entered later in the configuration of the Forms Add-on in the i-doit pro interface.

    Example: sudo ./run.sh instance:create forms1 abDzfk74dsfi55FOS32

We have to create a Service for the Forms backend, so it runs in the Background

In order to use forms-service.sh, we must first set the rights to run it:

    sudo chmod +x forms-service.sh

We now have the systemd service created for the Forms backend.<br>
The Service will be activated and started:

    sudo ./forms-service.sh

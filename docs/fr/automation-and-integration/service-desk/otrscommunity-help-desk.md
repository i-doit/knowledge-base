# ((OTRS)) Community Edition Help Desk

[((OTRS)) Community Edition](https://otrscommunityedition.com/) is a web application for setting up and operating a service desk. This application and i-doit are able to exchange data via ((OTRS)) Community Edition modules. By this means, ((OTRS)) Community Edition tickets with objects from i-doit can be linked with each other.

## ((OTRS)) Community Edition-Modules

Currently there are several ((OTRS)) Community Edition modules and you can find an up-to-date list of them on the i-doit [i-doit website](https://www.i-doit.com/en/i-doit/add-ons/).

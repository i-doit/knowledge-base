# Zammad

[Zammad](https://zammad.com/) is a Web application suited for your service desk. It will display information about i-doit objects and connect tickets with objects. For more information about its configuration and usage, please contact the vendor behind Zammad.

After a regular installation i-doit is already able to [access Zammad tickets](./index.md).

FAQ:

One important thing that is often forgotten is that elasticsearch must be installed and working on the Zammad server, without this service i-doit cannot retrieve the tickets.

To test the connection from the i-doit server to the Zammad server a curl can be used:

    curl -u user@domain.de -X POST http://myzammadserver/api/v1/tickets/search -d 'query=preferences.idoit.object_ids:myobjectid' -d 'limit=10'

Please extend the curl so that you can authenticate.

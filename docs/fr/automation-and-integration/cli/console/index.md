# Console

i-doit has a Command line Interface (CLI) with which you can carry out various tasks. For example, the CLI is required for [Cronjobs](../../../maintenance-and-operation/cronjob-setup.md) and can be applied for the automation of work steps.

## First Steps

The CLI can be found in the i-doit installation directory, for example at **/var/www/html/**. Within this directory the CLI has to be activated with the same permissions as the Apache webserver. Under **Debian GNU/Linux** this is the user called **www-data**. You can achieve the permissions with **sudo**:

```sh
cd /var/www/html/
sudo -u www-data php console.php
```

Under Windows you also have to change to the installation directory. As the permissions of the webserver are not an issue, the start of **php.exe**, which has to stand in the path of the user, is sufficient.

```cmd
cd C:\xampp\htdocs
php.exe console.php
```

When you execute the CLI without further arguments, the general help is displayed:

??? abstract "Available commands without add-ons"
    ```sh
    i-doit console utility 31

    Usage:
    command [options] [arguments]

    Options:
    -h, --help            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the list command
    -q, --quiet           Do not output any message
    -V, --version         Display this application version
        --ansi|--no-ansi  Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
    -n, --no-interaction  Do not ask any interactive question
    -v|vv|vvv, --verbose  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug

## Authentication Process

In order to access i-doit via the CLI an authentication is required for most of the commands. For this purpose, you hand over a user name, the appropriate password and the desired [tenant ID](../../../system-administration/multi-tenant.md). With a default installation, in most cases the latter is **"1"**.

```shell
cd /var/www/html/
sudo -u www-data php console.php [COMMAND] --user admin --password admin --tenantId 1 [FURTHER OPTIONs]
```

!!! success "The user "controller""
    We recommend creating a dedicated user in i-doit for the application of the CLI. If this user is to be configured as [local user](../../../user-authentication-and-management/builtin-authentication/creating-a-local-user.md), create it as object of the type **Persons** with the desired credentials in the **Persons â†’ Login** category. This user should receive admin rights. The rights assignment can be carried out through allocation to the predefined **Person group Admin**.

## Help

Often commands are accompanied by further arguments. Therefore each command provides a help via **--help**:

```shell
cd /var/www/html/
sudo -u www-data php console.php search --help
```

Furthermore, some commands provide examples via **--usage**.

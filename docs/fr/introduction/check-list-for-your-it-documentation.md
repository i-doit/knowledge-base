# Check List for Your IT Documentation

A good [IT documentation](../glossary.md): What is it that makes a difference? At bookshops you can find extensive literature to deal with the subject in detail and as a whole.

Our suggestion: Quick successful results first, and then you can consider things as a whole. The following checklist helps you to take a pragmatic approach to achieve first successes. But nevertheless, we recommend the literature ;-)!

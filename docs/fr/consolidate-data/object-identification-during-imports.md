# Object Identification during Imports

i-doit provides various data imports. Existing data in the [IT documentation](../glossary.md) can be updated with imports instead of generating (often) unnecessary redundancy. In order to achieve this, i-doit tries to identify existing [objects](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) by means of various [attributes](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md).

## Data Imports Concerned

The following data imports are considered in this article:

*   [CSV file import](./csv-data-import/index.md)
*   [JDisc Discovery](jdisc-discovery.md)
*   [h-inventory](h-inventory.md)

Other data imports might have another way of proceeding.

## Approach

The identification of objects is carried out in two steps:

1. The unambiguous attributes of the respective data sources have the highest priority:

    CSV data import: _not applicable_<br>
    JDisc: Device ID<br>
    OCS Inventory NG: _not applicable_<br>
    h-inventory: Serial number<br>

    With the first data import, these attributes are saved and can then be used as identification feature for following data imports. If these attributes are not available, step 2 follows.

2. A so-called object matching (see below) is carried out by means of profiles.

## Creation of Profiles

Some attributes are suitable to reference objects [unambiguously](../basics/unique-references.md). You can use this characteristic regarding the data import of third-party applications with similar unambiguity. To be prepared for various import cases you can create so-called object-matching profiles in i-doit which are to be observed during import. The central configuration is under **Administration → Interfaces / external data → Import → Object-matching profiles**. You can create any number of profiles.

[![objidi-create-profiles](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/object-identification-during-imports/1-oidi.png)](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/object-identification-during-imports/1-oidi.png)

The i-doit default installation already contains a profile named **Default** which mustn't be edited or deleted. With the **New** button you can create a new profile, with **Edit** you can edit a profile while **Purge** deletes a profile irrevocably.

Several details are required per profile:

*   **Name**: a meaningful description of the profile
*   **Matchings**: Various attributes and other fields can be selected. With help of these attributes and fields already documented objects are searched and compared to the data to be imported. The order is irrelevant and cannot be changed.
*   **Minimum Match**: During the matching process of data and objects to be imported in i-doit a check is carried out as to how many attributes of an object have to match. The selectable number follows the number of attributes under **Matchings**.
*   **Filter für neue Objekte (JDISC)**:<br>**The New object filter option only affects NEW objects when importing JDiscs**. Exclude objects from import that do not have configured attributes. Possible attributes are host name, serial number, object title, MAC and IP address.
*   **Minimale Filterübereinstimmung (JDISC)**:<br>Minimum number of missing attributes to ignore **NEW** import objects.

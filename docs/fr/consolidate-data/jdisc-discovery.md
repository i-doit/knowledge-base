# JDisc Discovery

[JDisc Discovery](http://www.jdisc.com/en/) makes an inventory of whole networks and recognizes all important operating systems (including HP-UX, Solaris and AIX). It recognizes hardware and software, IP networks, Windows domains and Active Directory. In addition, JDisc Discovery identifies all important virtualization technologies, as well as many cluster environments.

## Installation

The installation of JDisc server components on a Microsoft Windows system (preferably the server version) is required for its operation. The necessary installation files can be downloaded via the following web address:

[https://jdisc.com/downloads/](https://jdisc.com/downloads/)

During the setup you will be asked which passwords are to be used for the PostgreSQL-DBMS, which is applied in the background. This concerns the administrative account **postgres** and the account **postgresro**, which only has read permission for the JDisc database. The latter account is required for the interface to i-doit. Besides, with the setup you have to specify that the PostgreSQL instance should be accessible to the outside. As a default, it observes port **25321**. You have to activate the port in the Windows firewall.

The JDisc documentation can be found at [https://jdisc.com/support/documentation/](https://jdisc.com/support/documentation/).
If you have any questions regarding the installation or configuration of JDisc, please contact the manufacturer's support [https://jdisc.com/support/](https://jdisc.com/support/).

!!! info "JDisc WebService see [JDisc FAQ](https://jdisc.com/support/faq/)"
    > The WebService implements access to some JDisc Functionality using a SOAP interface on port 9000. However, with the new GraphQL-based API, the SOAP service is obsolete. I-Doit can access our GraphQL-API to perform the same tasks as with the WEB Service starting with i-doit Release 22.<br>
    > Simply change the protocol in i-doit to HTTPS and use port 443 and then i-doit will use the GraphQL API and you can uninstall the obsolete WEB Service Add-On.<br>
    > The GraphQL-API offers two major advantages:<br>
    > It is using HTTPS by default (as with the WEB Service, HTTP was used by default)<br>
    > It is a modern and powerful API that lets you automate everything in JDisc.<br>

## Configuration

The configuration of the interface is under **Administration → Import and interfaces → JDISC → JDisc configuration**. You can define any number of instances of JDisc Discovery. This allows complex inventory scenarios with separated networks.

!!! info "Archive outdated objects"
    To archive objects that have not been seen by JDisc for a certain number of days, the threshold value and the threshold value unit must be set at **Administration → [Tenant name] management → Settings for [Tenant name] → JDisc**.

### JDisc configuration

| Parameter                                | Comment                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default Server**                       | Is the instance involved which is to be suggested with a manual import?                                                                                                             |
| **Host**                                 | Host name / FQDN or IP address of the JDisc instance; this has to be accessible from the i-doit instance.                                                                           |
| **Port**                                 | Open port of the PostgreSQL instance which runs in the background of JDisc Discovery.                                                                                               |
| **Database**                             | JDisc Discovery uses the **inventory** database as a standard.                                                                                                                      |
| **Username**                             | Enter one of the accounts which were requested during setup. You can use the account **postgresro** with limited rights, because i-doit only needs reading access for the database. |
| **Password**                             | The password assigned during setup which belongs to the used account.                                                                                                               |
| **Allow import of older JDisc version?** | This query is only relevant for older versions of JDisc Discovery.                                                                                                                  |

After the parameters are saved, you can test the connection to the JDisc database with the **Check connection** button.

To archive objects that have not been seen by JDisc for a certain number of e.g. X days, the threshold value and the threshold value unit must be set under **Administration → [Tenant name] management → Settings for [Tenant name] → JDisc**.

| Parameter          | Anmerkung                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Threshold**      | Eine Zahl einfügen. When the setting is defined, the objects have not been seen by JDisc within this time period will be archived on import. |
| **Threshold unit** | Days, Weeks oder Month                                                                                                                       |

### Discovery settings

The user can activate a scan with the configured JDisc instance with i-doit. For this purpose, the JDisc Discovery web service is used, provided it is installed and activated.

| Parameter    | Comment                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Username** | The account to be used for the web service. |
| **Password** | Password for the account                    |
| **Port**     | Use **443** for GraphQL                     |
| **Protocol** | Use: **https** for GraphQL                  |

After saving the parameters, you can test whether the configuration was successful with the **Check connection** button.

## JDisc profiles

The JDisc profiles of i-doit provide the possibility to define the connection of object types and their attributes between JDisc and i-doit. Under **Administration → Import and interfaces → JDISC → JDisc profiles** you can specify how the objects found by JDisc find their way into the IT documentation.

[![jdisc-discovery-profiles](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/2-jd.png)](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/2-jd.png)

The i-doit default installation already provides predefined profiles. Among these predefined profiles is the **Complete import** profile which has the purpose to import all data in i-doit which have been inventoried by JDisc.

!!! note "Create your own profiles"
    Keep in mind that you would need to alter these profiles to fit your installation and available types of objects from JDisc mapped to i-doit object types.

### General configuration

### Object-type Assignment

For each type in JDisc you can select an equivalent object type in i-doit. If none is selected, devices of this type will not be imported. The order of allocations is observed during import. In order to identify an allocation, the list is processed from top to bottom. For each line the matrix has the following structure:

### Custom identifier

!!! attention "Matching rule"
    The `deviceid` from JDisc is always used to identify objects.

JDisc `deviceid` should be assigned with type JDisc when the object is created in the **Custom identifier** category. This is intended to identify the objects later on.
If no data is available, the object matching profile is used.

## Import of Data via the Web GUI

The import of data contents from JDisc is carried out via **Extras → Import → JDisc**.

[![jdisc-discovery-import](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/3-jd.png)](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/3-jd.png)

Before you execute the import process, you have to define the import parameters.<br>
Because it is possible to apply more than one JDisc server, you have to select the JDisc server in the first step. The profile which you defined beforehand can be also selected to influence the imported contents and their use. In addition, you can set the import mode. The **Append** import mode creates all found objects without checking whether these already exist. The **Update** import mode creates only objects which can't be found in the i-doit data pool. Categories of already existing objects are complemented (if necessary) with new data. The **Overwrite** import mode is, in principle, like the **Update** mode but with the difference that list categories are emptied first and are then recreated.

| **Import Mode**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Append**                            | The import mode **"Create"** will create all found objects without checking if they already exist.                                                                                 |
| **Update**                            | The import mode **"Update"** will only create objects that could not be found in i-doit. Categories of already existing objects will be supplemented with new data (if necessary). |
| **Overwrite**                         | The **"Overwrite"** import mode behaves exactly like the "Update" mode with the difference that list categories are first emptied and then newly created.                          |
| **Update (Existing only)**         | The addition of "(Existing only)" will update only existing objects, no new objects are created.                                                                                  |
| **Overwrite (New inventory)**         | With the addition **"(New inventory)"** fixed i-doit-to-jdisc-device links are discarded and the object associations are recalculated.                                             |
| **Only create newly scanned devices** | The "**Only create newly scanned devices"** Mode creates only objects that do not exist in i-doit.                                                                                 |
| **Update (New inventory)**            | With the addition **"(New inventory)"** fixed i-doit-to-jdisc-device links are discarded and the object associations are recalculated.                                             |

With the logging function you can influence the extent of the written log. A more extensive logging increases the import duration.<br>
When you carried out the settings completely, you can activate the import with **Start the import**. Please, consider that the duration of the import process depends both on the size of the JDisc database and the utilized hardware.<br>
When the import process is completed, a summary is displayed in the **Result** section.<br>
You can find the logs which are generated during import in the i-doit directory called `log/`.

## Import via JDisc Discovery category

You can update individual objects using the JDisc Discovery category.
Here it is possible to scan the device using a specific identification (host address, FQDN and serial number).

[![JDisc Profile](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/6-jd.png)](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/6-jd.png)

You can add the category via the object type configuration of the object type.

## Import via i-doit Console

Importing data from JDisc to i-doit is not only possible manually via the user interface. It can also be executed via the i-doit [Console](../automation-and-integration/cli/console/index.md) and thus automated. How the corresponding call is generated can be found in the [corresponding article](../automation-and-integration/cli/console/options-and-parameters-cli.md) with an example for the import-jdisc option.

For the import, the ID of the desired profile can be specified. The ID can be found in the list of profiles:

[![jdisc-discovery-id](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/4-jd.png)](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/4-jd.png)

Also the ID of the JDisc server to be used can be specified. This can be found in the configuration:

[![jdisc-discovery-server](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/5-jd.png)](../assets/images/en/consolidate-data/jdisc-discovery/5-jd.png)

A jdisc.ini might look like this more information about .ini files can be found [here](../automation-and-integration/cli/console/using-configuration-files-for-console-cli.md).

```ini
[commandArguments]
[commandOptions]
user=admin
password=admin
tenantId=6
profile=1
group=
mode=1
server=2
overwriteHost
detailedLogging=3
regenerateSearchIndex
[additional]
```

If we assume that the jdisc.ini is located in the i-doit root directory, then the import is called with the ldap.ini from the i-doit root directory like this:

```shell
sudo -u www-data php console.php import-jdisc -c jdisc.ini
```

### JDisc availability Report

At **Report Manager -> Views** is a report with the name **JDisc availability**, which compares i-doit objects with JDisc objects.

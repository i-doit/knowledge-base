# Replacement

A new switch is put into operation but you want to maintain all the connections? Use the **Replacement** [add-on](./index.md) so that you don't have to document all the connections anew. This add-on allows swapping of [objects](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) with configurable adoption of existing connections.

Download and Installation
-------------------------

This add-on can also be installed at a later time. You can find detailed descriptions about download, installation, updates etc. in the "[i-doit pro Add-ons](./index.md)" article.

Configuration
-------------

You can find the configuration at **Administration** **→ CMDB settings → Object swap → Configuration**. For the most part, you can use the configuration to define default values in order to standardize and speed up frequent swapping.  

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Selectable object-types** | Here you specify which objects of which type can be swapped. Additionally, you define per [object type](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) which [categories](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) (and thus which [attributes](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md)) are to be swapped. The categories which aren't selected aren't affected by swaps. |
| **CMDB status for storing objects** | You can restrict the selection of objects offered for swapping via their [**CMDB status**](../basics/life-and-documentation-cycle.md). |
| **Consider the "swap" status?** | When the swap status is considered, the swapped object receives the **CMDB status** **stored** and the object of swapping the **CMDB status in operation**. |
| **Archive swapped objects?** | Do you want the object which is swapped to receive the [status](./../basics/life-and-documentation-cycle.md) **Archived**? |
| **Also swap the SYS-ID?** | Do you want to swap the **SYS-ID** attribute in the **General** category? This is [an attribute for unique referencing](../basics/unique-references.md). |

Rights Assignment
-----------------

Under **Administration → Authorization system → Rights → Object swap** you can specify [rights for persons and person groups](../efficient-documentation/rights-management/index.md).

| Condition | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Swap objects  <br>** | Does the user have permission to swap objects? |
| **Swap by workplace  <br>** | Does the user have permission to swap workplace components? |
| **Swap CI module configuration  <br>** | Does the user have permission to adjust the configuration (see above)? |
| **Swap CI-button in object list** | The user can swap objects via the [action bar of the object list](../basics/object-list/index.md). For this purpose, the **Swap** button will appear in the action bar. |
| ****Swap CI-button in objects**** | Via the action bar within an object, the user can swap the object with another one. For this purpose, the **Swap** button will appear in the action bar. |

Requirements
------------

Before two objects can be swapped, the following conditions have to be met:

*   Both objects have the same object type.
*   You can't swap an object with itself.

Object Swap
-----------

There are three ways to swap an object for another one:

1.  Select both objects within an [object list](../basics/object-list/index.md) and click the **Swap** button in the action bar.
2.  Click the **Swap** button in the action bar within an object and then select the object of swapping  under **Stored object.**
3.  Select both objects under **Object to swap** and **Stored object** at **Extras → Object Swap.**

Now you can swap the selected objects by clicking the **Change** button.

[![Change](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/replacement/2-rp.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-pro-add-ons/replacement/2-rp.png)

After selecting both objects, you can adjust further options. The preselection is from the above mentioned configuration.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Zu übernehmende Kategorien**<br><br>****(Categories to adopt)**** | see above |
| **Consider the "swap" status?** | see above |
| **Archive swapped objects?** | see above |
| **Also swap the SYS-ID?** | see above |

By clicking the **Start swapping** button both objects will be swapped.

Swap by Workplace
-----------------

You can carry out a preselection for swapping via assigned workplaces. First select an object type under **Extras → Object swap → Swap by workplace**. Then all objects of the type **Workplace,** in whose **Workplace components** category objects of this type are assigned, will be listed. You select an object for swapping from the respective workplace. With the button  **Swap selected objects** you can reach **Extras → Object swap → Swap objects**.

Swap Report
-----------

A report about swapping actions which have been carried out so far is generated under **Extras → Object swap → Swap-report**. You can also reach the reports item via **Extras → Report Manager → Views → Swap-report**.

Hosts can be hierarchical ordered in folders. These folders can be synced to i-doit and additional folders in i-doit can be used to generate new folders in checkmk. Just run:

[?](#)

`idoitcmk` `sync``-folders`

In i-doit these WATO folders are stored in the dialog+ attribute `WATO folder` in category `Check_MK Host`.

**Recommendation:** Run this command every time you add a new folder in checkmk or i-doit.

# Configuration in i-doit

In order for the frontend to be able to communicate with the backend, we have to store the previously used user name and the API key in the [tenant settings](../../system-administration/administration/tenant-management/settings-for-tenant.md).<br>
These are accessed via `Administration → Tenantname mangemant → Settings for ACME IT Solutions → Forms Add-on`.

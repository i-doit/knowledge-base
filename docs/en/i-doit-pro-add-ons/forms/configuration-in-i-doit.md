# Configuration in i-doit

In order for the frontend to be able to communicate with the backend, we have to store the previously used user name and the API key in the [tenant settings](../../system-administration/system-settings/tenantsettings.md).<br>
These are accessed via `Administration → System Settings → Tenant Settings → Forms Add-on`.

# Actions in Object Lists

Above the [object list](./index.md) is the action bar with which you can carry out various actions.

## Create an Object

Various options are available for the creation of a new object:

-   **New** or **New object** create a new object which you can edit via forms.
-   **New object from template** changes to the dialog which creates one or more objects from a [template](../../efficient-documentation/templates.md).
-   **New template**e is similar to the first item, but the [state](../life-and-documentation-cycle.md) **Template** is preselected so that the object becomes a [template](../../efficient-documentation/templates.md) after saving.

## Edit an Object

When you want to edit an object, select the object to be edited with the corresponding checkbox and click the **Edit** button. When you select more than one object, the [list editing](../../efficient-documentation/list-editing.md) function is started.

## Duplicate an Object

Use the **Duplicate button** to [duplicate an object with its attributes](../../efficient-documentation/duplicate-objects.md).

## Objects: Archive, Mark as Deleted, Restore or Delete Irrevocably

You can click the corresponding buttons to **Archive**, **Delete**, **Restore**, **Purge** and **Quickpurge** when you want to change the [state](../life-and-documentation-cycle.md) of one or more objects or you even want to delete them irrevocably.

## Print Preview

A pop-up window showing the list with an optimized view for printing opens by activating the **Print Preview** button. The list is supplemented with attributes which are displayed on the summary page of the corresponding object.

!!! success "Print preview of the web browser"
    The applied web browser can also generate a print preview. Here the superfluous elements of the Web GUI are not displayed:

    -   Firefox: **File → Print preview**
    -   Chrome: **Menu → Print...** or **CTL+P**

## Export Object List as CSV file

You can download the displayed object list [as a file in CSV format](../../consolidate-data/csv-data-export.md) with the **Export as CSV** button and then process it with third-party applications.

## Link to this page

To reload the page and thus the object list you can use the **Link to this page** button. This button is also useful to get the unique URL. However, it should correspond to the URL shown in the address bar of the web browser.

## Change of state

If you want to display only objects with a certain [state](../life-and-documentation-cycle.md), you can select the corresponding state with the drop-down menu on the right side of the action bar. You can see how many objects are in the respective state by the indications enclosed in parenthesis. As standard, the selected state is set to **Normal**. A change to another state is saved and therefore affects all other object lists.

You can activate the template filter in objects lists in the [Administration](../../system-administration/administration/tenant-management/settings-for-tenant.md#templates)

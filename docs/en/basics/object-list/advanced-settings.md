# Advanced Settings

Many parameters concerning the [object lists](index.md) can be adapted according to your requirements. This increases clarity and provides the possibility to gain access to desired contents quickly.

## Adapting the Number of Objects per Page

You have the possibility to define the number of displayed [objects](../structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) per page for the system. This is a custom setting so that all users are able to determine the objects per page for their own view individually. You can enter and set the number with [**Administration → User settings → User interface**](../../system-administration/administration/user-settings/user-interface/index.md). A very high value may reduce performance.

## Maximum Length of Object Titles

Depending on how many attributes or columns are to be displayed in a list, it may be useful to limit the maximum length of the object title. Should an [object title](../unique-references.md) exceed this length, it will be abbreviated with three dots (...) from the specified length. You can adapt the maximum length with [**Administration → [Tenant-Name] management → [Tenant-Name] Settings → Maximum lengths → Object title in lists**](../../system-administration/administration/tenant-management/settings-for-tenant.md#maximum-lengths). Enter the desired maximum length as a positive integer into the text field.

## Activation/Deactivation of the Quickpurge button

You can add the [**Quickpurge**](../../system-administration/administration/tenant-management/settings-for-tenant.md#cmdb) button to the action bar in object lists. With **Administration → [Tenant-Name] management → [Tenant-Name] Settings → Activate quickpurge button** you can either select **Yes** to display the button or **No** so that it isn't shown.

## Activation/ Deactivation of the Drag and Drop function

An object can be assigned to another [object type](../structure-of-the-it-documentation.md) by using the drag and drop function. With [**Administration → [Tenant-Name] management → [Tenant-Name] → Settings Graphical interface → Drag 'n' Drop of objects**](../../system-administration/administration/tenant-management/settings-for-tenant.md#graphical-interface) you can either activate the function by
choosing **Yes** or deactivate it by choosing **No**.

## Display of Templates in Object Lists

Templates aren't displayed in object lists in i-doit. However, you can display them beside Norma, Archived and Deleted as templates. Use [**Administration → [Tenant-Name] management → [Tenant-Name] Settings → Templates → Show template filter in object lists**](../../system-administration/administration/tenant-management/settings-for-tenant.md#templates) to carry out the corresponding settings.

# Web GUI

The i-doit GUI is a WEB application that can be used with the respective [supported browser](../installation/system-requirements.md). This Knowledge Base article describes the various features and functions of the Web GUI.

Logon Screen
------------

When you activate i-doit after successful installation, the logon screen is displayed first. Here you can logon to i-doit directly or you can go to the [Admin Center](../system-administration/admin-center.md) by clicking the "Admin-Center" button in the lower area of the window.

For log-in to i-doit our default users apply, such as Admin, Archivist, Author, Editor or Reader, provided that i-doit was installed only just. All these users have their name as password, for example, you can log-in with the user name "Admin" and the corresponding password "Admin".

Start Screen, Dashboard and Widgets
-----------------------------------

After successful log-in, the start screen with the [dashboard](./dashboard-and-widgets.md) and its [widgets](./dashboard-and-widgets.md) is opened.

Objekt Type Group Selection
---------------------------

In the central part of the upper task bar you can see the single [object type](./object-types.md) groups. You can adapt this area completely to your requirements and depending on your configuration it can look completely different. By selecting a single menu item, the respective object type groups are displayed within the tree view on the right-hand side of the i-doit user interface.

When you are in the object view mode, the corresponding tree view is shown. With this view you can, for example, display all object types of the selected object type groups or when you are within an object, you can see the categories assigned to this object.

## Location View

From the objects in i-doit which present a location, the location view creates a hierarchical view based on their relations to each other. Here you can navigate to the respective locations and jump to the assigned objects.

| - | - |
| Physical location | TODO |
| Logical location | TODO |
| Combined view | TODO |

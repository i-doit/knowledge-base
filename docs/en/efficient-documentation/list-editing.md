# List Editing

The list editing function enables simultaneous and easy editing of multiple [objects](../glossary.md). Editing is carried out per [category](../glossary.md).

-----------------------

You can find the list editing at **Extras → CMDB → Listen editing**.

Alternatively, you can open the list editing function by selecting multiple objects in an [object list](../basics/object-list/index.md) via their checkboxes and then clicking the **Edit** button.

Selection of Objects and the Category to be Edited
--------------------------------------------------

When you activate the list editing using the **Extras**  menu, you can select the objects you wish to edit in the next step. You can also choose the [category](../glossary.md) you want to edit. Additionally, you can define a filter to limit the shown entries to a specific selection. For example, you can display only software assignments of a specific software.

Execution of the List Editing
-----------------------------

As soon as the objects and the category have been selected, the list editing will load. You will receive a list of objects, including the properties of the selected category. Each line represents a single object.

Changes within a line of an object just change the [attribute](../glossary.md) of the object. Changes in the uppermost line assign the same value to all objects in the selected attribute. These changes are applied as soon as you click the **Save** button.The placeholder **##COUNT##** allows for an automated sequential numbering of the data records. It is also possible to let the numbering start from a specific value and to determine the leading zeros. Examples for this are available in the bottom section of the list editing.A counter will show you the number of applied changes.

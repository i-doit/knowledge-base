## Logbook Configuration

In the logbook configuration you can define how many changes may be combined as a maximum in a logbook entry, if the user only should be displayed with his/ her ID or in an extended way and if yes, how this should look like. Additionally, you can determine the number of combined changes per logbook entry during an import procedure. → [READMORE](../../basics/logbook.md)

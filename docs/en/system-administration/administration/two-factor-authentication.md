# Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

This page has been created so that an administrator is able to help users who no longer have access to their configured 2FA.
The 2FA can be **deactivated** for the respective user via the **Action** column. It is also possible to open the person via the **Link** button.

## Rights assignment

The rights are automatically added to the admin person group after the update. The right can be found under **Authorizations -> Administration** and is called **Two-factor authentication**.

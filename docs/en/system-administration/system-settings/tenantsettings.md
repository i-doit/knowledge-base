Unique checks (evaluation only during import/export processes!)

Graphical interface
-------------------

This sets the maximum character length for Dialog-Plus Field Contents, Object Title in Location Path, and Complete Length of a Location Path.

These specify how many characters the entire path or the individual objects in the path may consist of. If object titles or the complete path are longer, they are shortened by "...".

# Add-on & Subscription Center

Add-on & Subscription Center enables the comprehensive management of add-ons. Users can **install**, **update** and **uninstall** add-ons, with specific permissions required to perform these actions. The feature also provides an overview of the current and latest versions of the installed add-ons as well as information on the required i-doit versions for each add-on version. We provide you with commercial information so that you know how much each add-on costs or what the license requirements are.

!!! info "**To access the Add-on & Subscription Center page, the token must only include one client.**"

The page can be accessed via the Admin Center login page. The page can also be accessed by clicking on the avatar in i-doit and selecting Add-on & Subscription Center.

# Release Notes 30

We're happy to announce i-doit pro 30. This version will bring a bunch of new features and improvements to enhance your i-doit experience. First of all we happily announce that **MariaDB 10.11** is officially supported with i-doit 30. Paired with **PHP 8.2** you are now able to update your operating system without having to worry about i-doit's compatibility.
This also means that i-doit 30 will be the ^^last version supporting PHP 7.4^^.
We also added a new feature to use **two-factor authentication (TFA)** for user's login. This can be paired with all common authenticators (for example as a browser extension or as an app on your mobile phone). To further improve your experience we cleaned up the settings area by combining the attribute settings for **validation** and **visibility** into **one single configuration**. This allows you to perform these settings much quicker and increases the clarity of the existing settings. To further improve the experience we cleaned up the menu for **Extras** to give quick access to all features below without nested menus.

Alongside i-doit 30 we will also launch **API version 2.0**. You will find more information below in the add-on section of our release notes.

**Highlights in this release**

-   New **MariaDB 10.11** compatibility. (please check compatibility for older versions)
-   **Optional** [two-factor authentication (TFA)](../../user-authentication-and-management/2fa/index.md) for i-doit login process.
-   **Combined** configuration page for **validation** and **attribute visibility**.
-   Simplified **Extras** menu to provide **quicker access**.

**Add-ons**

As mentioned above we will also release a new version 2.0 of the i-doit API. This version will clean up a lot in the backend of the add-on as well as introduce new pull and push endpoints. This is the **first step** of a completely **reworked API** for i-doit.

-   [API 2.0](../../i-doit-pro-add-ons/api/index.md)

Please make sure that you fulfill all the [requirements](../../installation/system-requirements.md) before installing these new versions. MariaDB 10.2 and MariaDB 10.3 will no longer be supported with i-doit 30.

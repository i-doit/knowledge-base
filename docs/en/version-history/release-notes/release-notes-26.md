# Release Notes 26


We're happy to announce i-doit pro 26. This version will start the introduction to new PHP versions by officially supporting PHP 8.1. Don't worry, if your operating system requires you to use PHP 7.4. This version will still be compatible with i-doit until the end of 2023, so you have a bit more time to prepare your system.

We have done some cleanup by removing the old "Controller" functions which have been replaced by the [Console](../../automation-and-integration/cli/console/index.md)-Commands in 2017. Alongside this removal, we have also removed code from unused interfaces and updated our template engine to improve the overall performance and user experience.

We encourage you to [update](../../maintenance-and-operation/update.md) to this release as soon as possible to benefit from all of these improvements.

# Release Notes 25

We’re happy to announce i-doit pro 25. With the latest version we release the next big change to improve i-doit’s interface: A complete rework of the i-doit [Administration](../../system-administration/administration/index.md). The structure will help long term users and new users alike to navigate to the desired configuration with ease. We also added a search function for this menu structure. Furthermore, settings that affect the whole installation (and not only the current tenant) have been moved to the [Admin Center](../../system-administration/admin-center.md).

We encourage you to [update](../../maintenance-and-operation/update.md) to this release as soon as possible to benefit from all these contents.

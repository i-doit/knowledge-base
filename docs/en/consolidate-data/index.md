# Consolidate Data

When you break down the [IT documentation](../glossary.md), you always end up with data. Different data in various forms (usually as text) are collected somewhere in order to be organized in i-doit and to be stored in a structured way. Data can also be reused somewhere else in another context. The following articles address the question of  where “somewhere” is. To put it briefly: Where do these data come from and where are they needed?

# Reports

The VIVA2 add-on installs several reports assigned to the "IT-Grundschutz" report category. This currently includes four "standard" reports:

## Requirements assigned to me

This report shows all open requirements that are assigned to the currently logged-in user in the IT-Grundschutz check (as "responsible for implementation"), sorted by the planned implementation date.

## Report: Missing responsibilities

This report shows all target objects/target object groups assigned directly to an information scope that do not have a contact assignment with one of the following roles:

-   Service-Manager
-   IT-GS: Informationssicherheitsbeauftragter (ISB)
-   IT-GS: Grundsätzlich zuständig
-   IT-GS: Fachverantwortliche
-   Administrator

## Report: Responsibilities

This report shows all target objects/target object groups assigned directly to an information scope with their contact assignment that has one of the following roles:

-   Service-Manager
-   IT-GS: Informationssicherheitsbeauftragter (ISB)
-   IT-GS: Grundsätzlich zuständig
-   IT-GS: Fachverantwortliche
-   Administrator

## Report: Covered by information scopes

This report shows all objects—sorted by information scope—that are either assigned directly to an information scope or are members of a target object group assigned to an information scope.

The six variable reports are all integrated via identically named custom categories on the [information scope] and described there.

# Maintenance

You can plan, coordinate and control maintenance dates with help of the **Maintenance intervals**  [add-on](./index.md). Planned maintenance works can be linked to any [objects](../basics/structure-of-the-it-documentation.md). You will receive notifications automatically via e-mail so that you do not miss the maintenance works.

Download and Installation

You can subsequently install the **Maintenance intervals** add-on. The article "[i-doit Add-ons](./index.md)" provides detailed descriptions regarding download, installation, updates etc.

## Configuration

A separate configuration is not planned.

## Rights Management

You can set [rights for persons and person groups](../efficient-documentation/rights-management/index.md) under **Administration → Authorization system → Rights → Maintenance**.

[![maintenance work](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/3-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/3-main.png)

## Archived Maintenance Works

If a maintenance work is marked as completed, it will not appear in the **Planning** section anymore (see above). Instead, it will be listed under **Extras → Maintenance → Planning (archive)**.

[![Archived Maintenance Works](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/4-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/4-main.png)

## Create an Overview

A detailed overview of all objects for which maintenance works have been planned or already completed can be found at **Extras → Maintenance → Overview**. You can define a time period for filtering purposes (option **From** and **To**).

[![Create an Overview](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/5-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/5-main.png)

## Create a Report

You can create a report listing the planned and completed maintenance works and download it as PDF file. This function can be found under **Extras → Maintenance → Maintenance annual report (Export)**. Alternatively, you can reach this function at **Extras → Report Manager → Views → Maintenance annual report (Export)**. You can choose from the following options:

| Option                        | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Headline**                  | Headline of the report                                                                                                                                           |
| **Maintenance type  <br>**    | Restriction to a certain type                                                                                                                                    |
| **From**                      | Start date                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Logo for PDF header  <br>** | Additional picture which is included in each page; the picture has to be available as [file object](../use-cases/upload-and-link-files.md) in i-doit beforehand. |

With the **PDF Export & Download** button you can create the PDF file and download it.

[![PDF Export & Download](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/6-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/6-main.png)

## Maintenance Information for each Object

During the performance of maintenance works for an object you can find a symbolic representation within the object. On every page of an object, i.e. the overview page or within the categories, you can see the information that the objects is **In maintenance** at the moment.

[![Maintenance Information for each Object](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/7-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/7-main.png)

## Maintenance Works on the Dashboard

You can display the dates of scheduled and completed maintenance works in the calendar widget on the [dashboard](../basics/dashboard-and-widgets.md) and highlight these dates.

[![calendar widget](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/8-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/8-main.png)

## Create E-mail Templates

You can generate an e-mail for scheduled maintenance works to inform the persons involved. The persons are either specified as recipient or via their assigned roles. Under **Extras → Maintenance → Email templates** you can define which text is to be send via e-mail to the persons in question. Any number of templates is possible which can be assigned to each single scheduled maintenance work (see above).

[![Create E-mail Templates](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/9-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/9-main.png)

Use the **New** button to create a new e-mail template and the **Edit** button to change an existing template. With **Delete** you can delete e-mail templates irrevocably.

The form to create or edit e-mail templates offers the following options:

| Option    | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| **Title** | Subject line of the e-mail |
| **Text**  | Text of the e-mail         |

You can use placeholders for both the **Title** and the **Text** which are then replaced before the sending process. The list of available placeholders can also be found on this page.

[![placeholders](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/10-main.png)](../assets/images/en/i-doit-add-ons/maintenance/10-main.png)

## Automatic Sending of E-mails

Actually, the e-mails are sent via the [console](../automation-and-integration/cli/index.md), the CLI Tool of i-doit, in the background. For this purpose, the **maintenance** handler is used. We recommend setting up a Cronjob for the automated sending of e-mails.

Example:

    sudo -u www-data php console.php --user admin --password admin maintenance

Thus, you can automate the process and do not have to send e-mails manually anymore (**Send emails** button under **Extras → Maintenance → Planning**).

## CLI console commands and options

| Command                       | Internal system description                                              |

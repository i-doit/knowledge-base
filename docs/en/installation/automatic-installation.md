# Automatic Installation

This article describes the automatic [IT documentation](../glossary.md) of i-doit. All the required configuration steps are executed on a newly installed GNU/Linux operating system and i-doit is installed. Additionally, Cronjobs, backups and other useful CLI tools are included. Only the execution of a script is required for this purpose.

## Scope

✔ Installation of software packages
✔ Configuration of software packages
✔ Installation of i-doit
✔ Set-up of Cronjobs
✔ Set-up of backups
✔ Set-up of Restore

## Requirements

*   The [system requirements](system-requirements.md) **have to be fulfilled**. An exception is the LAMP stack (Apache Web Server, MariaDB/MySQL, PHP).
*   One of the [supported](system-requirements.md) GNU/Linux operating systems is installed freshly. We recommend Debian GNU/Linux 10 "Buster".
*   The system can access i-doit packet repositories and web services via an internet connection.

## Use

The installation is carried out by a [script](https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-scripts#install-i-doit-on-a-gnulinux-operating-system) which is executed on the operating system.
The following steps are carried out via the command line. For this purpose, you can connect, for example, via **SSH**. Afterwards, you download the script and enable its execution:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-doit/scripts/main/idoit-install
chmod 755 idoit-install
```

The scipt has to be executed with **root** rights. If **sudo**  is available:

```shell
sudo ./idoit-install
```

Alternatively, you log in as **root**:

```shell
su
./idoit-install
```

The script asks several questions regarding the configuration. For all questions there are predefined answers which you can accept by pressing `**ENTER**`.

# Installation

The [IT-documentation](../glossary.md) should be based on a solid foundation – the same applies to the technical side. Three types of installation are available for i-doit.

|     | [Automatic Installation](automatic-installation.md) | [Manual Installation](manual-installation/index.md) | [i-doit Virtual Eval Appliance](i-doit-virtual-eval-appliance/index.md) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Topic | All the required configuration steps are executed on a newly installed GNU/Linux operating system and i-doit is installed. Additionally, Cronjobs, backups and other useful CLI tools are included. Only the execution of a script is required for this purpose. | The required software packages are installed and configured independently. Afterwards, i-doit is downloaded and installed. The necessary steps for Cronjobs and backups also have to be carried out by the user. | A VM with a pre-installed current version of i-doit is available for users of i-doit pro during the evaluation phase. The operating system is Debian GNU/Linux. |

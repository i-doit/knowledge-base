# System requirements

In order to guarantee the operation of all functionalities of i-doit, some requirements must be met by the underlying system.

!!! info "Current version"

    The requirements shown below apply to the current version of i-doit, in this case **25**. These requirements are adjusted for each major release of i-doit. If the requirements of older versions are needed, the change history of this page can be used.

## Minimum Requirements

The following system parameters are the minimum requirements to guarantee i-doit to work with up to around 10,000 objects and up to 10 users working simultaneously.

### Virtual Hardware

*   2 vCPUs
*   2 GB RAM
*   10 GB free disc space

We recommend the use of a dedicated virtual machine. The actual demand for hardware is based on the scope of the [IT documentation](../glossary.md) and the amount of simultaneous users.

### Operating System

*   [Debian GNU/Linux](manual-installation/debian.md) 10 "buster", 11 "bullseye"
*   [Ubuntu](manual-installation/ubuntu-linux/index.md) 18.04 LTS "bionic", 20.04 LTS "focal fossa"
*   [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)](manual-installation/suse-linux-enterprise-server.md) 15, 15 SP1, 15 SP2, 15 SP3
*   [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](manual-installation/red-hat-enterprise-linux/index.md) 7, 8
*   [Microsoft Windows Server](manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/index.md) 2016, 2019


We recommend the usage of [Debian GNU/Linux](manual-installation/debian.md) in 64bit architecture (amd64) in version 11 "bullseye".

### LAMP Stack

*   Apache Web server 2.4
*   MariaDB 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6 (recommended) or MySQL 5.7.
*   PHP >= 7.4, 8.0 (recommended) _At the moment, PHP version 8.1 is not supported. We plan the support of PHP 8.1 in a later release._
*   PHP extensions: bcmath, ctype, curl, fileinfo, gd, imagick, json, ldap, mbstring, memcached, mysqli, mysqlnd, pgsql, session, soap, xml, zip


We recommend the usage of **Apache Webserver 2.4, PHP 8.0 and MariaDB 10.6**.

!!! success Reference configuration

    The following system parameters comprise a configuration reference that is tested and recommended by us and guarantees high performance when used with up to 500,000 objects and a high number of simultaneously working users.

    ### Virtual Hardware

    *   2 vCPUs
    *   8 GB RAM
    *   50 GB free disc space

    ### Operating System

    [Debian GNU/Linux](../installation/manual-installation/debian.md) 10 "buster" (64bit)

    ### LAMP Stack

    *   Apache 2.4.x (default package)
    *   MariaDB 10.6.x (default package)
    *   PHP 8.0.x (default package)

    !!! note Note

        Because i-doit is a database application, it intensively uses the hard drive. Since the I/O throughput strongly determines the performance, a fast hard drive is recommended.

        The need for disc space can increase with intense usage of file or image storage in i-doit.

        The value of 50 GB is solely geared to the maximal size of the database, which can be achieved by full usage, updates and similar operations.

## Client

A Web browser is needed on the client side in order to access the Web GUI of i-doit. For each Web browser the current version as well as the version prior to this are supported:

*   Mozilla Firefox (including the last ESR version)
*   Google Chrome/Chromium
*   Microsoft Internet Explorer/Edge (disabled compatibility mode)
*   Apple Safari

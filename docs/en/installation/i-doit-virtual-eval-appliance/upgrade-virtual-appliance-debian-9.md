# Upgrade of i-doit Virtual Eval Appliance to Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"

Besides the maintenance of i-doit you also have to keep the regular maintenance of the operating system in mind. This article explains the upgrade of [Debian GNU/Linux](../manual-installation/debian.md) in version 8 "Jessie" to version 9 "Stretch". It takes just a few steps and the [i-doit Eval Virtual Appliance](index.md) will be up to date.

!!! note "Why should I upgrade?"

    Why should you upgrade your operating system to the latest version? There are good reasons for this:

    1.  The IT documentation contains [sensitiva data which need to be protected](../../maintenance-and-operation/security-and-protection.md). This can only be guaranteed when all system compontents are up to date.
    2.  The change from PHP 5.6 to 7.0 results in a measurable improvement in performance.

## Requirements

Before upgrading, you have to consider the following:

- The upgrade only describes the i-doit Virtual Eval Appliance in Version 1.2.x.
- We assume that no changes of the system were carried out (except updates). We are not responsible for subsequent changes.
- There has to be enough available memory. The update requires approximately 1 GByte free memory.

## Tips

You also should pay attention to the following issues before an upgrade:

- Do you have [==backups==](../../maintenance-and-operation/backup-and-recovery/index.md)?
- You shoud inform i-doit users before downtime.
- Automatisms, cronjobs and external access should be stopped during the upgrade.

You can read many additional [==hints regarding the upgrade of the operating system==](https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/amd64/release-notes/index.en.html) provided by the Debian Community.

## Preparing the Upgrade

We connect via ==SSH== and activate item ==0 Launch Shell== in the menu.

Then we carry out updates:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt clean
```

Afterwards, the system needs to be rebooted. Because of an error the Linux kernel has to be up to date:

```shell
sudo systemctl reboot
```

After the restart, we connect again via SSH and activate the shell in the menu to ensure that version ==8.8== is used:

```shell
cat /etc/debian_release
```

If this is not the case, the upgrade will fail.<br>
As a precautionary measure you should stop the webserver so that i-doit is not activated in the meantime:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop apache2.service
```

Now everything is prepared for the upgrade.

## Performing the Upgrade

Now the sources for the distribution packages are adapted:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

The following line is supplemented at the end:

```shell
deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian stretch main contrib
```

All previous lines are commented out; a ==#== is used as a prefix for each line.<br>
Then all package sources are updated and a package upgrade is carried out:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

For the last command some user interactions are required:

1.  Answer the question ==Restart services during package upgrades without asking?== with "==Yes==".
2.  Answer the question regarding the overwriting of ==Configuration file '/etc/issue'== with ==N==.
3.  Answer the question regarding the overwriting of ==Configuration file '/etc/issue.net'== with ==N== as well.

Now the actual upgrade of the packages to new versions is carried out:

```shell
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

In order to activate the new Linux kernel the system is restarted:

```shell
sudo systemctl reboot
```

Thus the upgrade to version 9 is completed.

## Follow-up

After the restart we connect to the system again vai SSH and activate the shell in the menu.<br>
Now we clear up the distribution packages:

```shell
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt clean
```

Then Apache Webserver and PHP have to be adapted as PHP 7.0 instead of PHP 5.6 is provided:

```shell
sudo cp /etc/php5/mods-available/i-doit.ini /etc/php/7.0/mods-available/
sudo phpenmod -v 7.0 i-doit
sudo apt-get purge libapache2-mod-php5 php5
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php php php-bcmath php-cli php-common php-curl php-gd php-imagick php-json php-ldap php-mcrypt php-memcached php-mysql php-pgsql php-xml php-zip
sudo a2enmod php7.0
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
```

Changes to the configuration files are not necessary.<br>
Also the DBMS MariaDB has to be adapted:

```shell
sudo mv /etc/mysql/conf.d/i-doit.cnf /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/99-i-doit.cnf
sudo systemctl restart mysql.service
```

To guarantee the correct function of the welcome screen and the menu you have to modify some lines:

```shell
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/appliance_getip.sh
```

The contents is replaced by the following:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
/bin/hostname -I | awk -F: '{ print "                                "$1 }'
```

Also:

```shell
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/get-ip-address
```

Contents:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "                                         /bin/hostname -I"
```

And finally the version number of the appliance:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/i-doit/appliance.conf
```

Contents:

```shell
APPLIANCE_VERSION="1.3.0"
```

Now also the follow-up works are completed. You can now restart all automatisms. The downtime is over and users can work with i-doit as usual.

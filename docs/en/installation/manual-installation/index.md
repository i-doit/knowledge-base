# Manual installation

This article describes the manual [IT documentation](../../glossary.md) of i-doit. The required software packages are installed and configured independently. Afterwards, i-doit is downloaded and installed. The necessary steps for Cronjobs and backups also have to be carried out by the user.

## Scope

:material-check: Installation of software packages<br>
:material-check: Configuration of software packages<br>
:material-check: Installation of i-doit<br>
:material-check: Set-up of Cronjobs<br>
:material-check: Set-up of backups<br>
:material-check: Set-up of Restore

## Requirements

- The [system requirements](../system-requirements.md) ==have to be fulfilled== .
- One of the [supported](../system-requirements.md) GNU/Linux operating systems is installed with its current updates.
- The system is able to access package repositories via an ==internet connection== .
- The Apache module (==mod_php==) is applied. Alternative methods (Fast CGI, HHVM) are not taken into consideration.
- Furthermore a simplified setup is required ==i-doit is the main application== of the system and Apache Web Server, PHP as well as MariaDB/MySQL are installed locally.
- ==Firewall rules and open ports== i-doit is a typical web application, which means that i-doit is accessed via web browser for basic functionality. This usually happens via port 80 (unencrypted) or port 443 (encrypted). If a firewall is used, these ports have to be opened for incoming TCP connections. It is possible that you need further rules when you use additional functions ([notifications](../../evaluation/notifications.md), [interfaces to third-party applications](../../automation-and-integration/index.md)). The communication between i-doit and MySQL/MariaDB is carried out locally (port 3306 TCP) and normally no extra firewall rules are necessary for this.
- ==Security frameworks:== Please carry out the necessary configurations if a security framework, such as ==AppAmor== or ==SELinux==, is installed.

## Next Steps

The specific steps depend on the selected operating system:

- [Debian GNU/Linux](debian.md)
- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS](red-hat-enterprise-linux/index.md)
- [Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)](suse-linux-enterprise-server.md)
- [Ubuntu Linux](ubuntu-linux/index.md)
- [Microsoft Windows Server](microsoft-windows-server/index.md)

# i-doit via XAMPP

!!! note ""
    This article was last checked for i-doit version ==1.16.3==

!!! attention "Firewall"

    We deactivate the Windows Firewall for our installation so that RDP and the connection to the Webserver will function. The applications and ports should be configured precisely in the Firewall, however, we don't want to focus on that in this article.

## Step 1: Installation of XAMPP

First of all, download the XAMPP package at [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Here we use the installer (xampp-win32-XXX-installer.exe). Other packages are fine too. The compressed package (.zip), for example, can simply be extracted to C:\\. It is important to note that the installation path for XAMPP has to be "C:\\xampp" as "C:\\Program Files (x86)" has not enough permission rights, which most likely will result in a faulty installation. Bitnami is not needed and can be unchecked in the installation process.

Here the [System Requirements](../../system-requirements.md) of the respective i-doit version must be considered. Therefore, in this example the installation package → `xampp-windows-x64-7.4.20-0-VC15-installer.exe`

At least the components ==Apache==, ==MySQL== and ==PHP== must be installed.

[![Select components](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/1-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/1-mws.png)

The default folder is left as → ==C:\xampp==

[![Select install folder](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/2-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/2-mws.png)

Then we select the language, I leave it at ==English==.

[![Select language](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/3-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/3-mws.png)

The next few ==Next== \> buttons should be self-explanatory.

[![Completing](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/4-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/4-mws.png)

Now the installation is finished and we start the control panel of XAMPP by clicking Finish.

[![Control panel](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/5-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/5-mws.png)

## Step 2: Configuration of XAMPP

### PHP

Now we configure PHP. For this we click on the button Config → PHP (php.ini) to open the php.ini.

[![Configure php](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/6-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/6-mws.png)

Normally, the file should open automatically with the editor. We add the following settings at the end of the file and save:

```shell
allow_url_fopen = Yes
file_uploads = On
magic_quotes_gpc = Off
max_execution_time = 300
max_file_uploads = 42
max_input_time = 60
max_input_vars = 10000
memory_limit = 256M
post_max_size = 128M
register_argc_argv = On
register_globals = Off
short_open_tag = On
upload_max_filesize = 128M
display_errors = Off
display_startup_errors = Off
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
log_errors = On
default_charset = "UTF-8"
default_socket_timeout = 60
date.timezone = Europe/Berlin
session.gc_maxlifetime = 604800
session.cookie_lifetime = 0
```

_Additionally, for the LDAP extension, it may be necessary to copy the libsasl.dll file from `C:\\xampp\\php\\` to `C:\\xampp\\apache\\bin`._
_Also, under Dynamic Extensions, the `;extension=ldap` must be freed from the leading semicolon._

## Apache Webserver

Separate settings for the Apache web server are not necessary here.

### MySQL/MariaDB

Now we configure MySQL/MariaDB. For this we click on the button Config → my.ini.

[![Configure MariaDB](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/7-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/7-mws.png)

Normally, this file should also be opened automatically with the editor. We also add the following settings here at the end of the file and save:

```shell
[mysqld]
  
# This is the number 1 setting to look at for any performance optimization
# It is where the data and indexes are cached: having it as large as possible will
# ensure MySQL uses memory and not disks for most read operations.
#
# Typical values are 1G (1-2GB RAM), 5-6G (8GB RAM), 20-25G (32GB RAM), 100-120G (128GB RAM).
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1G
 
# Use multiple instances if you have innodb_buffer_pool_size > 10G, 1 every 4GB
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 1
 
# Redo log file size, the higher the better.
# MySQL/MariaDB writes two of these log files in a default installation.
innodb_log_file_size = 512M
 
innodb_sort_buffer_size = 64M
sort_buffer_size = 262144 # default
join_buffer_size = 262144 # default
 
max_allowed_packet = 128M
max_heap_table_size = 32M
query_cache_min_res_unit = 4096
query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_limit = 5M
query_cache_size = 80M
 
tmp_table_size = 32M
max_connections = 200
innodb_file_per_table = 1
 
# Disable this (= 0) if you have only one to two CPU cores, change it to 4 for a quad core.
innodb_thread_concurrency = 0
 
# Disable this (= 0) if you have slow harddisks
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1
innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
 
innodb_lru_scan_depth = 2048
table_definition_cache = 1024
table_open_cache = 2048
# Only if your have MySQL 5.6 or higher, do not use with MariaDB!
#table_open_cache_instances = 4
 
innodb_stats_on_metadata = 0
 
sql-mode = ""
```

## Step 3: Start Apache and MySQL

We click on the [![Start](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/8-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/8-mws.png) button for Apache and MySQL. If necessary, a firewall popup will appear.
Now both modules should be highlighted in green.

[![Started modules](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/9-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/9-mws.png)

### Password for the MySQL root

Now we should set a password for the MySQL root user.
For this we click on the [![shell](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/10-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/10-mws.png) button.

[![Shell and control panel](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/11-mws.png)](../../../assets/images/en/installation/manual-installation/microsoft-windows-server/xampp/11-mws.png)

First, we log in:

```shell
mysql -u root
```

Now we change the password, '_thisistotallysecure!!11_' should be replaced with your own password:

```shell
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'thisistotallysecure!!11';
```

## Step 4: Download and unzip i-doit

### Download and unzip i-doit

Now we download i-doit in the latest version from the customer portal.
We unpack the `idoit-1.xx.x.zip` under `C:\\xampp\\htdocs` and rename the folder to idoit.

## Step 5: Checking the installation

With the previous configuration we have prepared the web server. Now, when we call the IP of the system or localhost in a browser, we should get the welcome page of Apache displayed.
Under ==PHPInfo== in the menu you can check if the values set in php.ini were taken over correctly.

## Next Step

Now the operating system is prepared and i-doit can be installed.

Proceed to [==Setup== …](../setup.md)

### FAQ

With XAMPP `xampp-windows-x64-8.0.23-0-VS16-installer` a new version of the PHP extension gd was added.
Therefore the `php.ini` should not be replaced by the one of the PHP 7.4 version.

For PHP 7.4 it was called `extension=gd2` and in PHP8.0 it is called `extension=gd`.
